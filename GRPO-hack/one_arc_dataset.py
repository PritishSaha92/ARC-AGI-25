To determine the total number of popsicle sticks Sam, Sid, and Steve can use for their Art class activity, we can use the following steps:
1. Let's denote the number of popsicle sticks that Steve has as \( S \).
2. According to the problem, \( S = 12 \).
3. Since Sid has twice as many popsicle sticks as Steve, we can calculate the number of popsicle sticks that Sid has as \( S 	imes 2 = 12 	imes 2 = 24 \).
4. Sam has thrice as many popsicle sticks as Sid, so we calculate the number of popsicle sticks that Sam has as \( 3 	imes 24 = 72 \).
5. The total number of popsicle sticks they can use is the sum of the popsicle sticks that Sam, Sid, and Steve have: \( S + Sid + Sam = 12 + 24 + 72 = 108 \).
Therefore, the total number of popsicle sticks they can use for their Art class activity is \(oxed{108} \).

I need to identify the pattern in these examples to solve the abstract reasoning challenge. Let me examine how the 3×3 input grid transforms into the 9×9 output grid.
Looking at the examples, I notice that the output grid can be divided into nine 3×3 sections. The original input grid appears in some of these sections but not others.
Let me analyze Example 1:

The input grid appears in the top-left (0,0), top-middle (0,3), middle-left (3,0), and bottom-right (6,6) sections of the output.
Looking at the input grid itself, I notice non-zero values at positions: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,1), and (2,2).

I'm beginning to see a pattern: For each non-zero element in the input at position (i,j), the entire input grid is copied to position (3i,3j) in the output grid.
Testing this rule:

Input has 6 at (0,0) → Copy input to (0,0) in output ✓
Input has 6 at (0,1) → Copy input to (0,3) in output ✓
Input has 6 at (1,0) → Copy input to (3,0) in output ✓
Input has 6 at (2,1) → Copy input to (6,3) in output ✓
Input has 6 at (2,2) → Copy input to (6,6) in output ✓

This rule holds for all examples!
For the test input [[7,0,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,0]], the non-zero positions are:
(0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)
So I should copy the input grid to positions:
(0,0), (0,6), (3,0), (3,6), (6,0), (6,3)

To solve this abstract reasoning challenge, I need to find the pattern that transforms the 3×3 input grid into the 9×9 output grid.
Looking at the examples carefully, I notice something interesting. The output grid can be divided into nine 3×3 sections, and the original input grid appears in some of these sections but not all of them.
After analyzing all examples, I can identify the pattern:

The output is a 9×9 grid composed of nine 3×3 sections
For each non-zero element in the input grid at position (i,j), the entire input grid is copied to the section starting at position (3i,3j) in the output grid

Let me verify this with Example 1:

Input has 6 at (0,0) → Copy input to section starting at (0,0) ✓
Input has 6 at (0,1) → Copy input to section starting at (0,3) ✓
Input has 6 at (1,0) → Copy input to section starting at (3,0) ✓
Input has 6 at (2,1) → Copy input to section starting at (6,3) ✓
Input has 6 at (2,2) → Copy input to section starting at (6,6) ✓

Now, for the test input:
7 0 7
7 0 7
7 7 0
The non-zero positions are: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)
Therefore, I should copy the input grid to sections starting at:
(0,0), (0,6), (3,0), (3,6), (6,0), (6,3)
